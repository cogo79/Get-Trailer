# Get-Trailer

I used Node version 4.4.4 and npm version 2.15.1. So if you run in to any trouble with runing this server you can try to change to does versions. Here is a handy link that I like for changing Node version.

After you have cloned this repository "cd" in to it in the terminal and run "npm install".

To test the server you can run the following command in the terminal:
curl -H Content-Type:application/json -X POST -d '{"trailer":"https://content.viaplay.se/pc-se/film/ted-2-2015"}' http://localhost:3000/trailer

Or if you have Mocha installed you can just run command "mocha" in the terminal to start all of my automated tests.

Have a good one ;D
